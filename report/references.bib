Lett.23, 409 (1998)] for evaluating the zero-order Hankel transform is generalized to high-order Hankel transforms. Since the method preserves the discrete form of the Parseval theorem, it is particularly suitable for field propagation. A general algorithm for propagating an input field through axially symmetric systems using the generalized method is given. The advantages and the disadvantages of the method with respect to other typical methods are discussed.}, number={1}, journal={JOSA A}, publisher={Optica Publishing Group}, author={Guizar-Sicairos, Manuel and Gutiérrez-Vega, Julio C.}, year={2004}, month=jan, pages={53–58}, language={EN} }

This approach produces results indistinguishable from methods such as coupled wave theory, and it allows one to reproduce other X-ray optical phenomena such as grazing incidence reflectivity where the direction of energy flow is changed significantly. Just as finite element analysis methods allow engineers to compute the thermal and mechanical responses of arbitrary structures too complex to model by analytical approaches, multislice propagation can be used to understand the properties of the real-world optics of finite extent and with local imperfections, allowing one to better understand the limits to nanoscale X-ray imaging.}, number={3}, journal={Optics Express}, publisher={Optica Publishing Group}, author={Li, Kenan and Wojcik, Michael and Jacobsen, Chris}, year={2017}, month=feb, pages={1831–1846}, language={EN} }
